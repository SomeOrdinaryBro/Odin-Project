# Odin Project Progress Tracker

Welcome to my progress tracker for Odin Project! My name is Sajid and I love learning programming. However, I tend to burn out quickly, so I created this repository to track my progress and keep myself motivated.

### About this Repository

This repository is where I will be tracking my progress through the Odin Project curriculum. I will be documenting my progress in each section of the curriculum, as well as any projects or exercises that I complete. This will help me stay organized and motivated, and also allow me to review my progress at any time.

### Progress Tracking

To keep track of my progress, I will be using the following system:

-   :white_check_mark: Completed
-   :x: In progress
-   :heavy_minus_sign: Not started

I will be updating this README file as I complete each section of the curriculum. I will also be including links to any projects or exercises that I complete.

### Curriculum Sections

Here are the sections of the Odin Project curriculum that I will be completing:

-   Foundations
-   HTML and CSS
-   JavaScript
-   Ruby
-   Rails
-   React
-   NodeJS

### Contact

If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact me. I am always looking for ways to improve my programming skills and this progress tracker, so any suggestions are welcome!
