        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Alright, folks, listen up! This is the recipe for the most amazing grilled cheese sandwich you'll ever taste. 
            All you need is some white bread, sliced cheese, and butter (or mayo, if you're feeling fancy). 
            And let me tell you, this sandwich is gonna make your taste buds dance.

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 slices white bread</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons butter (or mayo, if you wanna get freaky)</li>
                <li>2 slices Cheddar cheese (or whatever cheese you got, I ain't judging)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat up a skillet, baby. You want that bad boy to be hot.</li>
            <li>Butter one side of each slice of bread. (Or mayo it up, I don't care)</li>
            <li>Place one slice of bread butter-side down on the skillet. Top it with cheese. (Don't be stingy with the cheese, yo)</li>
            <li>Place the other slice of bread on top, butter-side up. (Or mayo-side up. Whatever floats your boat)</li>
            <li>Cook until the bottom slice is crispy and golden brown. (This is where the magic happens, people)</li>
            <li>Flip that bad boy over and cook until the cheese is melted and gooey. (Mmm, yes)</li>
            <li>Take it off the skillet and enjoy that cheesy goodness. (Don't burn your tongue, though. That's not cool)</li>
        </ol>
    </main>
