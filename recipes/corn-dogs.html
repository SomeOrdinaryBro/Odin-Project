    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A corn dog is a sausage (usually a hot dog) that has been skewered, coated in a cornmeal batter, and deep-fried. A staple of American cuisine, the street food was likely invented by German immigrants in Texas in the 1920s.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        These are the ingredients you'll need to make this homemade corn dog recipe:

        <ul>
            <li>Cornmeal and flour: This corn dog batter starts with yellow cornmeal and all-purpose flour.</li>
            <li>Sugar: A pinch of sugar lends a hint of sweetness.</li>
            <li>Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavened, which means it helps the batter rise.</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper: Salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.</li>
            <li>Milk: A cup of milk adds moisture, ensuring a tender coating.</li>
            <li>Egg: An egg gives the batter even more moisture and acts as a binder, which means it helps hold the batter together.</li>
            <li>Oil: Fry the corn dogs in a neutral oil with a high smoke point, such as vegetable oil.</li>
            <li>Beef frankfurters: This recipe calls for beef frankfurters, but you can use pork franks (or hot dogs) if you'd prefer.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h4>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade corn dogs:</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl; stir in milk and egg to make a batter.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Meanwhile, pat frankfurters dry and insert a skewer into each one. Roll frankfurters in batter until well coated.</li>    
        <li>Fry 2 or 3 corn dogs at a time in preheated oil until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels.</li>
    </ol>
