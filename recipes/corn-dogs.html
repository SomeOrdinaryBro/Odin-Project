        We all know that the best way to make hot dogs even more delicious is to impale them on a stick, smother them in batter and deep fry them until they are crispy golden brown. Introducing the Laugh-out-Loud Corn Dogs Recipe, a recipe that will make your taste buds tickle and your sides ache from laughter!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cornmeal and flour: This corn dog batter starts with yellow cornmeal and all-purpose flour. We tried using purple cornmeal, but the dogs ended up looking like bruises.</li>
        <li>Sugar: A pinch of sugar lends a hint of sweetness, just like your weird uncle at family reunions.</li>
        <li>Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavened, which means it helps the batter rise, like a hot air balloon or a politician's ego.</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper: Salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, just like how a good punchline enhances a joke.</li>
        <li>Milk: A cup of milk adds moisture, ensuring a tender coating, unlike your ex's heart.</li>
        <li>Egg: An egg gives the batter even more moisture and acts as a binder, which means it helps hold the batter together, just like how your friends hold you together when you're drunk.</li>
        <li>Oil: Fry the corn dogs in a neutral oil with a high smoke point, such as vegetable oil, like how you should be neutral in a heated argument.</li>
        <li>Beef frankfurters: This recipe calls for beef frankfurters, but you can use pork franks (or hot dogs) if you'd prefer. But just remember, pigs might fly, but they definitely won't make as good a corn dog.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl; stir in milk and egg to make a batter. Sing your favorite karaoke song while you mix the batter.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Meanwhile, pat frankfurters dry and insert a skewer into each one. Roll frankfurters in batter until well coated. Practice your juggling skills by tossing the skewered frankfurters in the air.</li>
        <li>Fry 2 or 3 corn dogs at a time in preheated oil until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels. While you wait for the corn dogs to cool, tell some funny jokes to your friends or family, or to yourself if you don't have any friends or family.</li>
    </ol>
