    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Cooking spray (because we're fancy like that)</li>
      <li>4 frozen breaded chicken breast fillets (we're not here to judge)</li>           
      <li>Â½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese (feel free to eyeball it, we won't tell)</li>   
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package frozen garlic bread, thawed (because who has time to make it from scratch?)</li>            
      <li>1 cup tomato sauce or marinara sauce (whatever's in the fridge)</li>
      <li>4 slices provolone cheese (or any cheese you have lying around)</li>           
      <li>12 fresh basil leaves, or to taste (or just skip it, who's counting?)</li>            
      <li>Aluminum foil (to keep the laziness contained)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spray a baking pan with cooking spray (fancy, right?).</li>
      <li>Place frozen chicken fillets on the prepared pan and bake for 10 to 12 minutes. Turn chicken, sprinkle 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese on each fillet, and bake until crispy, an additional 10 to 12 minutes (because crispy is the only way to go).</li>   
      <li>Slice garlic bread into 4 equal portions. Open each portion and place garlic side up on a baking sheet. Warm garlic bread in the oven about 5 minutes (or until you remember it's in there).</li>
      <li>To assemble the sandwiches, place a chicken fillet on a piece of garlic bread, spoon 1/4 cup tomato sauce or marinara sauce on top of the chicken, and lay a slice of provolone on top of the sauce. Place 3 basil leaves, or more to taste, on each sandwich, and top with the other half (because presentation is everything).</li>
      <li>Wrap each sandwich in foil and return to the oven until the cheese is melted, 5 to 8 minutes. Unwrap and serve warm (and pretend like you put in a lot of effort).</li>
    </ol>
