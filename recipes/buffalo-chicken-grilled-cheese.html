        </div>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix shredded chicken, buffalo wing sauce, and blue cheese in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Preheat a small skillet over medium heat and prepare yourself for the heat.</li>
            <li>Spread 1/2 tablespoon of butter on one side of a slice of bread. Place bread butter-side-down onto the skillet bottom and place pepper jack cheese on top. Top with chicken mixture. Butter a second slice of bread with remaining butter on one side and place on top of the sandwich, butter-side-up.</li>       
            <li>Cook the sandwich in the skillet until the bread is lightly browned, and flip it over to survive the other side; about 2 1/2 minutes per side. Remember to breathe!</li>
        </ol>

            This sandwich is not for the weak. Have a glass of milk nearby to soothe the burn, or better yet, have a fire extinguisher ready!
